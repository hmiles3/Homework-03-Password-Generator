# Homework-03-Password-Generator
This is an application meant to generate a random password based on the parameters given by the user. The first parameter is the length of the password, which must be between 8 and 128 characters. Next, the user will be asked whether or not the password should include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. The password that the user receives will be the length that they selected, using only the types of characters that belong to the selected parameters.
